# Team Page Generator (HTML)

## Description
My motivation was to create an automated tool that can take user input to generate an HTML file showcasing a team's details.
I built this project so that I can quickly create a presentable HTML file with details about my team.
The app solves the problem of having to think about how to structure a HTML and style it.
I learned that node.js is a very powerful automation tool and that it's essential to run server-side applications.
What makes my project stand out is that it gives you a quick and presentable HTML page with minimal effort.
